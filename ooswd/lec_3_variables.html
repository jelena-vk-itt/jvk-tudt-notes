              <h2>Variables</h2>
              <p>
                So far we have learnt about data types and how pieces of data
                can be manipulated, individually or in groups. However, the
                functionality that we have used for this has all been Python
                built-in functionality and the instances of data manipulation
                carried out have been tied to particular fixed data values or
                <strong>literals</strong>. We have more or less used Python as a
                sophisticated kind of calculator.
              </p>
              <p>
                To create some reusable functionality, in most cases we need to
                be able to manipulate <strong>placeholders</strong>, rather than
                only known data values.
              </p>

              <section class="ice">
                <p>
                  Can you think of two cases where a useful program can be
                  defined without placeholders i.e. work without inputs from the
                  outside world?
                </p>
              </section>

              <p>There are broadly two types of placeholders in programs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>function parameters</strong> (the pieces of data that
                  a function says it accepts), which are used as placeholders
                  for defining what the function does and are replaced by
                  arguments (actual pieces of data) when the function is called
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>variables</strong>, which are, within a context,
                  standalone placeholders for pieces of data
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Writing programs using only functions, with function parameters
                the only kind of placeholder, is called
                <em>functional programming</em> and can be pursued in Python
                (although it is not optimised for it), but this is not what we
                are going to do (especially since funcitions are not even on the
                syllabus!). So let's look at variables.
              </p>
              <p>
                Python has a very simple approach to variables. They are
                <strong>named</strong> and <strong>given a value</strong> in one
                expression, which can be placed anywhere in the code.
              </p>
              <h3>Variable naming and value assignment</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  a variable name
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      can include only alphanumeric characters and underscores
                      ('_')
                    </li>
                    <li>must not start with a number</li>
                    <li>
                      must not be a
                      <a
                        href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords"

			using any built-in function names (e.g. <span class="fw">str</span> or <span class="fw">len</span>) as variable names would make the functions unavailable and needs to be avoided; you can check if something is a built in function by typing in the name into the Python command line

                  the assignment is made with the
                  <strong>assignment operator <span class="fw">=</span></strong>
                  (this is different from the equality operator,

                <li>
                  the value assigned to a variable can be that of a

                  <em>more complex expression</em>

                  be used, for example to provide the value of another variable

              <h3>Assignment operators</h3>

              <p>
                Apart from the standard assignment operator,
                <span class="fw">=</span>, there are the
                <strong>augmented assignment</strong> operators, which combine
                another operation with assignment: <span class="fw">+=</span>,
                <span class="fw">-=</span>, <span class="fw">*=</span>,
                <span class="fw">/=</span> etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, <span class="fw">x += 3</span> means the same as
                <span class="fw">x = x + 3</span>, but is generally more
                efficiently implemented under the hood.
              </p>

            <p>Input</p>
            <article style="display:none">
              <h2>Input</h2>
              <p>
                One way of setting variables that we will use a lot in this
                module is input from the console. At this beginner level of
                programming, reading data from the console, in conjunction with
                printing, is an easy way to achieve two-way communication with
                the outside world and make a program useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the function <span class="fw">input()</span> is called, it
                waits for a line to be typed in and the Enter key pressed on the
                console. Then it returns the text contained in the submitted
                line, as a string value.
              </p>
              <figure id="py-input" class="my1">
                <figcaption>Input (run as script)</figcaption>
                <pre class="code-listing">
print("Enter some text:")
input()
# enter text on console, press Enter

print("Enter your name:")
name = input()
# enter name on console, press Enter
print("Your name is", name)
				</pre
                >
              </figure>

              <p>
                The code using <span class="fw">input()</span> in
                <a class="xref" href="#py-input">?</a> can be shortened by using
                an argument to <span class="fw">input()</span>. This argument is
                printed to prompt the user, rather than relying on a separate
                call to <span class="fw">print()</span>.
              </p>

              <figure id="py-input2" class="my1">
                <figcaption>Input with argument (run as script)</figcaption>
                <pre class="code-listing">

# enter text on console, press Enter

name = input("Enter your name: ")
# enter name on console, press Enter
print("Your name is", name)
				</pre
                >
              </figure>

              <p>
                It is important to remember that the value returned by
                <span class="fw">input()</span> is always a string. If a
                different type is required, a conversion needs to take place.
