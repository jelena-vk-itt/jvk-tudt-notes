		    <h2>Exercise 1: Dividing</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads two integers input by the user</li>
			<li>tells the user if the second number is a factor of the first number</li>
		    </ul>
		</section>


		<section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
		    <h2>Exercise 2: Grades</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads a percentage mark value input by the user</li>
			<li>if the entered mark is lower than 0 or greater than 100, informs the user that the input is invalid</li>
			<li>if the entered mark is valid, inform the user of the corresponding letter grade, if the grade mark ranges are as shown in the picture

		    <h2>Exercise 3: Home insulation grant</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads a house floor area (in sqm) input by the user</li>
			<li>reads a house type (detached, semi or terraced) input by the user</li>
			<li>calculates and informs the user of the amount that would be granted for external insulation if:
			    <ul>
				<li>the grant per sqm for the different house types is 2.5, 1.5 and 1 euro for detached, semi and terraced respectively</li>
				<li>there is a cap of 150sqm on the size for which the grant is given (a house larger than 150sqm gets a grant only for 150sqm)</li>
			    </ul>
			</li>
		    </ul>

		    <h2>Exercise 4: Find instances</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following:</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads in two strings</li>
			<li>finds all the non-overlapping instances of the second string in the first string</li>
			<li>prints the index positions in the first string at which the second string is found</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Example command line interaction:</p>
		    <div class="box bg-black white">
			<span class="fw">Please enter a string: </span><span class="fw red">Bananas, oranges and mangos.</span><br/>
			<span class="fw">Please enter the substring to search for: </span><span class="fw red">an</span><br/>
			<span class="fw">The substring appears at positions 1, 3, 11 and 17 in the string.</span>
		    </div>

		    <p>Further information:</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>you can implement this with a while loop, using each iteration to look for one appearance of the substring</li>
			<li>to look for an appearance of the substring, you should use the string method <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_find.asp">find</a>
			    <ul>
				<li>the method finds the position of a substring inside a string</li>
				<li>it can search from a position that is not the beginning of the string</li>
				<li>for example <span class="fw">"banana".find("an", 2)</span> looks for "an" in "banana" starting from position 2, i.e. actually looks for "an" in "nana"</li>
			    </ul>
			</li>
		    </ul>

		    <h2>Exercise 5: Password</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that:
			<ul>
			    <li>stores a string literal in a variable called <span class="fw">password</span></li>
			    <li>uses a while loop to read in a password string typed in by the user, giving them three tries to get it right by typing in the correct password</li>
			    <li>if the password is correct in one of the first three iterations, prints a message telling the user that they are logged in</li>
			    <li>if the password is incorrect three times, prints out an error message</li>
			</ul>

			Example command line interaction (password is "abc"):
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">xyz</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">hello</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">abc</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Thanks. You are logged in now.</span>
			</div>

			Another example command line interaction (password is "abc"):
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">xyz</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">hello</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">123</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">You have entered an incorrect password too many times. Please contact the administrator.</span>
			</div>

		    <h2>Exercise 6: Number list</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that:
			<ul>
			    <li>uses a while loop to read in numbers entered by the user, one number in each iteration</li>
			    <li>stores the entered numbers in a list</li>
			    <li>if a non-numeric value is entered, interprets this as a 'stop' signal, exiting the loop</li>
			    <li>prints the length of the list, the biggest and smallest number and the mean of the entered numbers</li>
			</ul>
			
			An example command line interaction:
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter a number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">1</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">3</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">5</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">7</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">9</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">11</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">13</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">a</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">You have entered 7 numbers.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Your smallest number is 1.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Your biggest number is 13.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The mean of your numbers is 7.0.</span>
