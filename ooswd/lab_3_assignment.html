		<h3>Some notation information</h3>
		<ul>
		    <li>Angular brackets containing descriptive text are placeholders, used to describe required input or other literals. For example,
			<ul>
			    <li>if an expected input string value is described as <em><strong>&lt;name></strong></em> then the actual value could be <span class="fw">John</span> or <span class="fw">Mary</span></li>
			    <li>if a value is described as <em><strong>&lt;date of birth in format dd/mm/yy></strong></em> then the actual value might be <span class="fw">01/01/01</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The actual value <strong>should not</strong> include angular brackets.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>If a command line window is shown to demonstrate requirements,
			<ul>
			    <li>text printed by the programe is displayed in white</li>
			    <li>user input is displayed in red</li>
			</ul>
			For example,
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter a number: </span><span class="fw red">42</span>
			</div>
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>General instructions</h3>
		<ul>
		    <li>In the submitted code you must use <strong>only</strong>
			<ul>
			    <li>the constructs covered in class so far</li>
			    <li>any additional string and list methods you might need</li>
			    <li>any additional constructs explicitly required by the exercise</li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
		    <li>Unless otherwise specified, you can assume a <strong>well behaved user</strong>, who always enters valid input.</li>
		    <li>Reading of user input must always be accompanied by a suitable textual prompt.</li>
		    <li>Printing of output must always be accompanied by a suitable textual heading or explanation.</li>
		</ul>

		    <h2>Exercise 1: Game results</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads user-input names of players in a game</li>
			<li>reads user-input scores for the players (these are integers and a higher score means a better result)</li>
			<li>finds and prints the highest score</li>
			<li>finds and prints the lowest score</li>
			<li>finds and prints the average score</li>
			<li>sorts and prints the list of players in order of their scores</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Tips:</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>The program must work for any number of players.</li>
			<li>You can use the functions <span class="fw">min()</span>, <span class="fw">max()</span> and <span class="fw">sum()</span> to find the score statistics that are required.</li>
			<li>The easiest way to sort the players is with the method <span class="fw">sort()</span> or function <span class="fw">sorted()</span> (<span class="fw">sorted()</span> does the same thing as <span class="fw">sort()</span> but does not modify the original list, returning a copy). To sort by score, you will need to use a key argument and as the conversion from name to score is a bit more complicated than the examples we covered in class, please look up the list notes (the section on sorting), which have been updated with information on lambda expressions (I know I said in the lecture that we would not be covering this but I realise sorting would be very limited without them). I will also post a short video with explanations in the recording section on Moodle.</li>

		    <h2>Exercise 2: Dividing</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads two integers input by the user</li>
			<li>tells the user if the second number is a factor of the first number</li>
		    </ul>
		</section>


		<section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
		    <h2>Exercise 3: Grades</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads a percentage mark value input by the user</li>
			<li>if the entered mark is lower than 0 or greater than 100, informs the user that the input is invalid</li>
			<li>if the entered mark is valid, inform the user of the corresponding letter grade, if the grade mark ranges are as shown in the picture
			    <figure class="one">

		    <h2>Exercise 4: Home insulation grant</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads a house floor area (in sqm) input by the user</li>
			<li>reads a house type (detached, semi or terraced) input by the user</li>
			<li>calculates and informs the user of the amount that would be granted for external insulation if:
			    <ul>
				<li>the grant per sqm for the different house types is 2.5, 1.5 and 1 euro for detached, semi and terraced respectively</li>
				<li>there is a cap of 150sqm on the size for which the grant is given (a house larger than 150sqm gets a grant only for 150sqm)</li>
			    </ul>
			</li>
		    </ul>
		</section>
		<section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
		    <h2>Exercise 5: Find instances</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following:
			<ul>
			    <li>reads in two strings</li>
			    <li>finds all the non-overlapping instances of the second string in the first string</li>
			    <li>prints the index positions in the first string at which the second string is found</li>
			</ul>
			Example command line interaction:
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter a string: </span><span class="fw red">Bananas, oranges and mangos.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter the substring to search for: </span><span class="fw red">an</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The substring appears at positions 1, 3, 11 and 17 in the string.</span>
			</div>
		    </p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
		    <h2>Exercise 6: Password</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that:
			<ul>
			    <li>stores a string literal in a variable called <span class="fw">password</span></li>
			    <li>uses a while loop to read in a password string typed in by the user, giving them three tries to get it right by typing in the correct password</li>
			    <li>if the password is correct in one of the first three iterations, prints a message telling the user that they are logged in</li>
			    <li>if the password is incorrect three times, prints out an error message</li>
			</ul>

			Example command line interaction (password is "abc"):
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">xyz</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">hello</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">abc</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Thanks. You are logged in now.</span>
			</div>

			Another example command line interaction (password is "abc"):
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">xyz</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">hello</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The password you entered is not correct. Please enter the password: </span><span class="fw red">123</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">You have entered an incorrect password too many times. Please contact the administrator.</span>
			</div>

		<section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
		    <h2>Exercise 7: Number list</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that:
			<ul>
			    <li>uses a while loop to read in numbers entered by the user, one number in each iteration</li>
			    <li>stores the entered numbers in a list</li>
			    <li>if a non-numeric value is entered, interprets this as a 'stop' signal, exiting the loop</li>
			    <li>prints the length of the list, the biggest and smallest number and the mean of the entered numbers</li>
			</ul>
			
			An example command line interaction:
			<div class="box bg-black white">
			    <span class="fw">Please enter a number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">1</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">3</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">5</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">7</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">9</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">11</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">13</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Please enter another number (or non-numeric value if finished):</span><span class="fw red">a</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">You have entered 7 numbers.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Your smallest number is 1.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">Your biggest number is 13.</span><br/>
			    <span class="fw">The mean of your numbers is 7.0.</span>
