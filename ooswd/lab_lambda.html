		    <h2>Exercise 1: Game results</h2>
		    <p>Write a Python program that does the following</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>reads user-input names of players in a game</li>
			<li>reads user-input scores for the players (these are integers and a higher score means a better result)</li>
			<li>finds and prints the highest score</li>
			<li>finds and prints the lowest score</li>
			<li>finds and prints the average score</li>
			<li>sorts and prints the list of players in order of their scores</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Tips:</p>
		    <ul>
			<li>The program must work for any number of players.</li>
			<li>You can use the functions <span class="fw">min()</span>, <span class="fw">max()</span> and <span class="fw">sum()</span> to find the score statistics that are required.</li>
			<li>The easiest way to sort the players is with the method <span class="fw">sort()</span> or function <span class="fw">sorted()</span> (<span class="fw">sorted()</span> does the same thing as <span class="fw">sort()</span> but does not modify the original list, returning a copy). To sort by score, you will need to use a key argument and as the conversion from name to score is a bit more complicated than the examples we covered in class, please look up the list notes (the section on sorting), which have been updated with information on lambda expressions (I know I said in the lecture that we would not be covering this but I realise sorting would be very limited without them). I will also post a short video with explanations in the recording section on Moodle.</li>
