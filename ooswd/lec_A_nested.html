				Nested for loops are fairly straightforward as a concept. They can
				be viewed as representing multi-dimensional tables, with an
				execution of the statement block in every cell. An example of
				printing out such a table is shown in code snippet
				<a class="xref" href="#py-for-2dimtab">?</a>.

			<p>Choosing the loops to use</p>

			    <h2>Choosing the loops to use</h2>
			    <p>
				Whether nested or not, we can be guided by the following when
				deciding if a loop should be 'while' or 'for':
			    </p>
			    <ul>
				<li>
				    use a for loop when the iterations will be determined before
				    execution of the loop
				</li>
				<li>
				    use a while loop when the iterations depend on an external or
				    random process
				</li>
			    </ul>

			    <h4>Example 1</h4>
			    <p>
				For example, let's say we want our program to draw random numbers
				between 0 and 5, looping until a 0 is drawn. Every time a number
				is drawn, the sequence of numbers from 1 up to the drawn number is
				printed.
			    </p>
			    <ul>
				<li>
				    The loop drawing random numbers until 0 needs to be a while loop
				    (exit defined by random process)
				</li>
				<li>
				    Printing out the sequence from 1 up to the drawn number needs to
				    be done within the statement block of the while loop and
				    requires a loop of its own, one that has it's iterations
				    enumerated before it starts [1..drawn_number], hence a for loop.
				</li>
			    </ul>
			    <figure id="py-for-in-while" class="my1">
				<figcaption>
				    Example of a for loop nested in a while loop

				<pre class="code-listing">
import random
n = random.randint(0, 5)
while n != 0:
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(str(i) + " ", end="")
    print("")
    n = random.randint(0, 5)</pre

				    Rewrite code snippet
				    <a class="xref" href="#py-for-in-while">?</a> so that, instead
				    of printing the range from 1 to the drawn number, it prints
				    numbers in the range [&lt;drawn number>, &lt;random number
				    between 6 and 10>].
				</p>
				<p>Did you have to change the types of loop used? Why?</p>

				</p>
			    </details>

			    <h4>Example 2</h4>
			    <p>
				Now let's write a script that repeats the following 10 times:
				draws random numbers between 0 and 5 until it gets a 5 and prints
				how many draws it took to get to a 5. A solution is in code
				snippet <a class="xref" href="#py-while-in-for">?</a>.
			    </p>
			    <ul>
				<li>
				    At the top level we have the requirement to do something 10
				    times. That is a for loop, as the number of iterations is
				    defined.
				</li>
				<li>
				    Inside the loop there is a repetitive (drawing random numbers)
				    with a random process determining the end. This needs to be in a
				    while loop.
				</li>
				<li>
				    This is also a case where we do not need to store the value of
				    the random draw but just check it, which means we can use the
				    call to <span class="fw">random.randint</span> directly in the
				    conditional expression.
				</li>
				<li>
				    We need to add a counter for the number of draws, which we set
				    to 1 to account for the final draw of a 5.
				</li>
			    </ul>

			    <figure id="py-while-in-for" class="my1">
				<figcaption>Random draws until 5, 10 times</figcaption>
				<pre class="code-listing">
import random
for i in range(0, 10):
    counter = 1
    while random.randint(0, 5) != 5:
        counter +=1
    print(counter)	    </pre

				<p>
				    Change the requirements for code snippet
				    <a class="xref" href="#py-while-in-for">?</a> so that a while
				    loop is a better fit for the outer iteration. Write the
				    corresponding code.
