		    <p>In this exercise you will be implementing a shop management application using classes.</p>
		    <ul>

			<img style="background-color: white;float:right; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 0.5em" src="res/images/first_class_assignment.png">
			<li>The application should consist of classes <span class="fw">Product</span> and <span class="fw">Shop</span> and a main program. Each class and the main program should be in a separate file (three files in total).</li>
			<li>The requirements for classes Shop and Product are shown in the UML class diagram. Study the diagram, then read the further instructions.</li>
			<li>The <span class="fw">Product</span> class should have:
			    <ul>
				<li>private instance member variables for the product name and stock count (string and integer respectively)</li>
				<li>a private class member variable called <span class="fw">LOW_STOCK_MARK</span> (all capitals indicating that this should stay constant) set to 3</li>
				<li>methods:
				    <ul>
					<li>a constructor, with parameters corresponding to the two member variables</li>
					<li>methods for getting and setting the stock and name values (4 methods in total); as these are private (e.g. <span class="fw">productObject._stock</span> is not allowed because <span class="fw">_stock</span> is a private member), we provide the methods for the variables to be read and modified from the outside without direct access</li>
					<li>a method that checks if the stock is low, by comparing it with the low stock mark</li>
				    </ul>
				</li>
			    </ul>
			</li>
			<li>The class <span class="fw">Shop</span> should have:
			    <ul>
				<li>a private instance member variable of type <span class="fw">list</span> that holds products (in the UML diagram, this is not shown by an attribute but as the aggregation relationship between the classes, however, it will be implemented as a member variable)</li>
				<li>a private instance member variable for the name of the shop</li>
				<li>methods:
				    <ul>
					<li>a constructor, with a parameter for the shop name</li>
					
					<li><span class="fw">add_product(self, name, stock)</span>, which creates and adds a product to the shop</li>
					<li><span class="fw">remove_product(self, name)</span>, which removes the product with name <span class="fw">name</span></li>
					<li><span class="fw">restock(self, name, quantity)</span>, which increases the stock of product with <span class="fw">name</span> by <span class="fw">quantity</span></li>
					<li><span class="fw">sell(self, name, quantity)</span>, which decreases the stock of product with <span class="fw">name</span> by <span class="fw">quantity</span></li>
					<li><span class="fw">print_product_list(self, low_stock_only)</span>, which prints the entire product list if <span class="fw">low_stock_only == False</span> and the list of products low on stock if <span class="fw">low_stock_only == True</span>; the default value for <span class="fw">low_stock_only</span> should be <span class="fw">False</span></li>
				    </ul>
				</li>
			    </ul>
			</li>
			<li>The file <em>main.py</em> should contain code for testing all the functionality of the <span class="fw">Product</span> and <span class="fw">Shop</span> classes.</li>
