			<p>Covering all bases</p>
			<article style="display:none">
			    <h2>Covering all bases</h2>
			    <p>When programming conditional statements it is important to <strong>stay in control</strong> by accounting for both branches of every condition, implicit or explicit.</p>
			    <h3>Implicit alternatives</h3>
			    <ul>
				<li>An alternative branch may be implicit with good reason, but deciding this must be part of the programming process.</li>
				<li>For example, I may want to issue a warning inside a stock-keeping application if the stock of a product is very low. If the stock is not low I <em>do not want the program to do anything</em>. This is a valid candidate for a conditional statement without an alternative branch. I am sure that nothing needs to be done if the condition is not met i.e. if there is enough stock.
				    <figure id="py-if-no-alt-corr" class="my1">
					<figcaption>Example of a conditional statement validly without an alternative</figcaption>
					<pre class="code-listing">
stock = 0 /* calculated in some way */
if stock < 2:
   print("WARNING: Stock is very low. Put in an order with supplier!")
/* no else needed */   </pre>
				    </figure>
				</li>
				<li>Nested conditional statements can make it harder to see 'un-covered' branches of execution. Consider the following example.
				    <figure id="py-if-no-alt-incorr" class="my1">
					<figcaption>Example of a missing alternative</figcaption>
					<pre class="code-listing">
age = int(input("Please enter your age:"))
hasProvisional = input("Do you have a provisional licence (y/n):")
if age >= 17:
   if hasProvisional == "y":
      print("You are eligible for a driving licence.")
else:
   print("You are not eligible for a driving licence.")</pre>

			    <h3>Hidden alternatives</h3>
			    <ul>
				<li>For all conditions, the condition and it's negative can be programmed into separate conditional statements. While this approach can be logically correct, it is
				    <ul>
					<li>inefficient (uses more computing power)</li>
					<li>harder to write</li>
					<li>harder to understand and maintain</li>
				    </ul>
				</li>
				<li>Look at the following example where we want the program to do one thing when x is equal to 3 and another when it is not equal to 3. The two conditional statements 'cover all bases' but inefficiently and 'messily'.
				    <figure id="py-if-no-alt-bad" class="my1">
					<figcaption>Example of hidden alternatives</figcaption>
					<pre class="code-listing">
print("Guess my lucky number (it's an integer): ", end="")

if x != 3:
   print("Sorry, that's not my lucky number :-(")</pre>

				<p><strong>Note on the example solutions</strong></p>
				<p>Both solutions are logically correct. The first one uses one conditional decision tree to decide which list of films to print. The second one uses two conditional statement trees, one for the over-15 and another for the over-18 film.</p>
				<p>The first example is a larger program i.e. would take up more space in memory. The other example (owing to the two decision trees) is slower. While the difference in size (three function calls) and speed (ratio 5:6 for conditional checks) are negligible in these small examples, in real-life projects design decisions of this kind are made as part of code optimisation.</p>

				<p><em>In class the main goal is to design <strong>correct</strong> solutions. If a particular form (e.g. an <span class="fw">elif</span> 'flat' decision tree) is required, this will be stated in the assignment specification but otherwise any correct solution is satisfactory.</em></p>
