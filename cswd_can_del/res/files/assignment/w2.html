		<h1>Client-Side Web Development - Weekly Assignment #2</h1>
		<ol>
		    <li>Open the file <em>index.html</em>, created during the completion of the first assignment and edit it as follows.</li>
		    <li>Include a Bootstrap 5 CSS stylesheet with the use of a <span class="fw">link</span> element.</li>
		    <li>Add a Bootstrap grid of elements arranged in three rows, all inside an element of class <span class="fw">container-fluid</span>. The first row should contain 3 column elements, the second 2 elements and the third 3 elements. Choose the column widths so that no two widths in a row are the same and so that each row is filled (widths must add up to 12). The content of the columns should be as follows:
			<ul>
			    <li>One of the eight columns in the layout should contain the table created in the previous assignment. Style the table by assigning it to the Bootstrap class <span class="fw">table</span>.</li>
			    <li>Another one of the columns should contain a piece of text, around 100 words in length, copied from a newspaper or similar website, in a paragraph element.</li>
			    <li>Another one of the columns  row should contain an image (if copyrighted make sure to reference the source in a comment in the HTML file).</li>
			    <li>The remaining five columns should contain elements with a border and with backgrounds coloured using at least three Bootstrap colours. These five elements should contain the following words: one, two, three, four, five (one each) and the words should be centred as well as possible, each within its element.</li>
			    <li>The grid should be collapsible i.e. the elements should be stacked at smaller screen/window widths.</li>
			    <li>All the elements in a row should be of equal height (use class <span class="fw">h-100</span> for this).</li>
			    <li>There should be some spacing between the rows, which is also visible when the layout is collapsed (use class <span class="fw">mt-3</span> for this).</li>
			</ul>
		    </li>
		</ol>
