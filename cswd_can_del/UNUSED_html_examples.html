	<h1>HTML Examples</h1>
	<h2>Formatting</h2>
	<p title="This is a tooltip">This is a paragraph with some text in <sub>subscript</sub> and some in <sup>superscript</sup>. Interesting!</p>
	<p>Now we have some <mark>marked</mark> text, some that is <ins>inserted</ins> and some that is <del>deleted</del>. How cool is that? :-[</p>
	<p>Finally, we can make it <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> (if it's just about the visuals) as well as  <strong>strong</strong> or <em>emphasized</em> (when the format carries semantic weight). We can also make it <small>small</small>!</p>

	<p>To get some text (e.g. a poem) displayed exactly the way it is written into the HTML, use the <b>pre</b> tag:</p>

	<pre>
A pre tag
      is a tag
           that allows
                mischief.    of    sorts   all
	</pre>
	
	<h3>We can override the direction of text with the <b>bdo</b> tag:</h3>
	<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>

	<h3>Colours</h3>
	<p>One way to specify a colour is to use a standard html colour name (the list of all 140 can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">here</a>.</p>
	<p>For example <span style="color:FireBrick">this text is displayed in the colour <b>FireBrick</b></span>.</p>

	<h2>Relating information</h2>
	<h3>Quoting</h3>
	<p>Now let's quote ourselves:</p>
	<blockquote cite="index.html">This is a paragraph with some text in <sub>subscript</sub> and some in <sup>superscript</sup>. Interesting</blockquote>
	<p>Or we can quote ourselves with a short quote for saying <q>if it's just about the visuals</q></p>
	<h3>Abbreviations</h3>
	<p><abbr title="Institute of Technology Tallaght">ITT</abbr> has joined forces with another two Institutes of Technology to form a Technological University.</p>

	<h3>Address</h3>
	<p>To display the address of the owner or author of the page, we use the <strong>address</strong> tag:</p>

	<address>
	    The Web Design and Development People<br>
	    Institute of Technology Tallaght<br>
	    Dublin 24
	</address>

	<h3>Work titles</h3>
	<p><cite>The Road to Middelharnis</cite> was painted by Meindert Hobbema in 1689.</p>
