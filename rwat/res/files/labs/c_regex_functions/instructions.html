        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a file called <em>index.html</em> and a file called
            <em>exercises.js</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <em>index.html</em>, create a basic HTML page using Emmet in
            Visual Studio Code (VSC) or in some other way. The page only needs
            to contain a heading (e.g. "Lab 3").
            <strong>Do not modify this file further in any way.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Exercises 2, 3, 4 must be completed in order.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure that the submitted HTML and Javascript content has no
            syntax errors. The Javascript file should also contain comments
            where needed for understanding the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            To submit, add the files to a directory called <em>lab3</em> in your
            RWAT repository in GitHub.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
          <h2>Exercise 1: Regular expressions</h2>
          <p>
            Open a copy of this instruction file or any other HTML file in
            Visual Studio Code. Press <strong>Ctrl-F</strong> to open the search
            dialog. Click on <strong>.*</strong> to the right of the search text
            field, so that the matching becomes regular-expression-based (see
            picture).
          </p>
          <img src="images/vsc_re.png" />
          <p>
            Using the VSC search field to check the correctness of your answer,
            write a regular expression to select each of the following:
          </p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha" start="1">
            <li>
              Any open tag without whitespace around the element name and
              without attributes (e.g. <span class="fw">&lt;div></span>)
            </li>
            <li>
              Any close tag not containing whitespace (e.g.
              <span class="fw">&lt;/div></span>)
            </li>
            <li>
              Any tag (open or close), with any contents (name attributes,
              whitespace)
            </li>
            <li>
              Any double letter (e.g. 'ee' or 'tt') - for this you should use
              backreferencing of matched groups
            </li>
            <li>
              A valid URL (you might have to write some URLs into the file in
              order to test this
            </li>
            <li>
              A valid Javascript variable name in terms of constituent
              characters and their ordering (you do not have to check for
              keywords)

          <h2>Exercise 3: Function currying</h2>

            By using
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"
              >tagged templates</a
            >
            (on the linked page, search for the example that contains the string
            't1Closure' and model your code on it), produce three templates for
            messages that will be sent to the students:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              "Dear &lt;name>, your average result for the semester is
              &lt;percentage>. Congratulations on your progression to the next
              semester!"
            </li>
            <li>
              "Dear &lt;name>, your average result for the semester is
              &lt;percentage>. Unfortunately, you have not passed and will have
              to repeat some exams."
            </li>
            <li>
              "Dear &lt;name>, your average result for the semester is
              &lt;percentage>. Congratulations, you have won the Best in Class
              award!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The items in angular brackets should be dynamically insertable into
            the messages from the student data array.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the template and without using any loops, display messages for
            all the students on the HTML page (you could use
            <span class="fw">reduce</span> to build the entire list of messages
            in a single string)
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="tutorial-panel clearfix">
          <h2>Exercise 4: Generators</h2>
          <p>
            Write a generator that goes on infinitely. Each value it yields
            should be a message saying "Hello &lt;name>, welcome to the new
            semester!", using the names of the students from the list in
            rotation. It should apply a random delay between 0 and 3 seconds in
            yielding the strings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Write some code that calls the generator and displays the messages
            as they arrive on the HTML page. Each new message should overwrite
            the previous one.
