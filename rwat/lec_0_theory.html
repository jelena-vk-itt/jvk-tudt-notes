				<li>What is the difference between <a href="#ARTCLID000119">full-stack development and client-side development</a>? Critically discuss with reference to technologies, applications, component and deployment architectures. Include a diagram.</li>
				<li>What are client-side rendering (CSR), static-site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) in the context of client-side Web development and how do they compare to each other? Discuss with reference to the relevant context, development, deployment, problem types to which each rendering approach is most applicable and include examples (<a href="https://medium.com/@khushbuchoksi/what-are-csr-ssr-ssg-and-isr-d59201e3b060">article</a>).</li>
				<li>What is client-side web development? Define and discuss with reference to development, deployment, technologies, suitable applications and anything else you know about it.</li>
				<li>What are Web APIs? Define and discuss with reference to where they are found and how they are used in Web development. Give examples of five Web APIs you have used in Web development, explaining their purpose and providing some examples of use with some code (or pseudocode).</li>

                            <h2>Long applied questions [1 x 20 marks on exam paper]</h2>
			    <p>In the exam, this question will describe an application in terms of a set of requirements and ask you to write a technology plan for its realisation. The required focus with respect to development stages (design, implementation, deployment, maintenance etc.) will be specified in the question. You will be asked to give both generic names and examples of specific technology products. Most of these questions will also require a diagram in the answer.</p>
			    <ol class="la">
				<li>You are managing a project to implement a game of <em>30 seconds</em>, with the following requirements:
				    <ul>
					<li>the game must be implemented as a static Web application</li>
					<li>it should be usable on both computer browsers and mobile devices</li>
					<li>the user should be able to create their own concept bank, save it and share it with other users</li>
					<li>the game uses a 30s timer</li>
					<li>the game should access concept banks as they are needed</li>
					<li>multiple developers with frequent updates to the application must be facilitated</li>
				    </ul>
				    Write a technology plan for this project, from the point of view of both development and any relevant operations. This should include as much detail as possible on technologies, how they are used and how they fit together. The plan should include a diagram, use generic technology names and give examples of specific products where relevant.
				</li>
				<li>You have been asked to implement a children's game using client-side web technologies. The requirements are as follows:
				    <ul>
					<li>the game must be implemented as a static Web application</li>
					<li>it will be used by sighted children and children with slight visual impairment, often needing pictures or text to be enlarged</li>
					<li>the children must be able to use a mouse to move objects around the screen</li>
					<li>the game should be usable both from a PC browser and from a mobile device</li>
					<li>a child playing the game should be able to save the game and resume playing at a different time (on the same device)</li>
					<li>data for the game is substantial and stored separately in one or more file; it is not known in advance which portions of the data will be needed</li>
					<li>the game needs to be developed quickly (so you ask a friend to help you)</li>
